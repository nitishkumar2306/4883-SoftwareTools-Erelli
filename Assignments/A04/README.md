## Project Title : Binary Search Tree Graph using Graphviz
### Name : Nitish Kumar Erelli
## Project Description : 
This assignment requires creating a graph representation of a binary search tree (BST) with seven nodes using the Graphviz online editor and the Dot language.

### Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the nodes are organized in a specific order. Each node in the BST has a key or value, and the keys in the left subtree are less than the key in the current node, while the keys in the right subtree are greater.

### Graphviz and Dot Language

Graphviz is an open-source graph visualization software. It provides tools for automatically generating visual representations of graphs. Dot language, the Graphviz's graph description language, allows you to define the structure and properties of graphs.

### Assignment Requirements

To complete this assignment, follow these steps:

1. Open the Graphviz online editor ([link to the editor](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)).
2. Create a new file and set the file type to "Dot".
3. Define the nodes of the binary search tree using the Dot language syntax. Each node should have a unique label or value.
4. Specify the relationships between the nodes using appropriate Dot language syntax. For a binary search tree, the left child of a node should be smaller, and the right child should be greater.
5. Customize the appearance of the graph, such as node shape, color, and edge styles, to make it visually appealing.
6. Once you are satisfied with your graph, export it as an image or generate the Graphviz source code for later use.
